# Script to get transcript as string

### The Ideia:

For this script works, you got install a add-on/extension called [Glasp](https://glasp.co/), it's a cool extension with many AI functions (Youtube Summary, WEB/PDF Highlight, AI Clone & Chat, Audio transcriber, and more), here I'll focus on **Audio transcriber**.

Here you can install on [firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-summary-with-chatgpt/)

### How It Works

The script extracts the transcript text and returns it as a string.

### Future Goal

I’m working on automating PDF generation from these transcripts—perfect for those (like me!) who prefer reading over watching tutorials.
